[root]
# This is an example application config using cement.  Some config options
# are required for cement, like 'enabled_plugins' but you can add any config
# options you like.  Only thing you have to have is the the above [root] 
# which ties this config to your 'root' namespace.

# PLUGINS
#
# Plugins are generally enabled under their [plugin] config either in this
# file or in the plugins.d config file for that plugin.  To enable a plugin
# set 'enable_plugin = true' under the plugins configuration.  
#
# Alternatively, a list of plugin names can be set under the root namespace.  
# These can be plugins from within your application, or shared plugin from 
# another application such as The Rosendale Project.
#
# enabled_plugins = example, rosendale.plugins.clibasic
#

# DIRECTORIES
#
# these should probably be changed for production installations if you 
# follow the FHS (and you should).
datadir = ~/helloworld/data
tmpdir = ~/helloworld/tmp

# This should be the path to your development tree ... /path/etc/plugins.d
plugin_config_dir = /path/to/helloworld/etc/plugins.d


# This is just a cosmetic option... whether to show 'loading plugin...'
# on application startup.
#
# show_plugin_load = true

# LOGGING
#
# Log file path, comment out if no log is required.
log_file = ~/helloworld/log/helloworld.log

# Toggle debug output... can be true, false
debug = false 

# Toggle the log level... can be info, warn, error, fatal, debug
log_level = warn

# Whether or not to log to console (this is overridden by 'debug')
log_to_console = true

# Max bytes to rotate log file on.  Comment out to not rotate log file.
#
# 512000000 = 512M
#
#log_max_bytes = 512000000 
#log_max_files = 4

# ROOT APPLICATION SETTINGS
#
# Add any config options you'd like here
#
# myoption = this is my option


# [namespace]
# Additional namespace/plugin configurations can go here.
