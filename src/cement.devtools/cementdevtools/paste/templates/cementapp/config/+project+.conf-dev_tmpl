# This is an example application config using cement.

# PLUGINS
#
# Plugins are enabled under their [plugin] config either in this
# file or in the plugins.d config file for that plugin.  An example plugin
# config looks like:
#
#   [example]
#   enable_plugin = true
#   provider = rosendale
#
#
# The 'provider' is the package that provides it.  If it is an internal plugin
# this can be left blank.
#

# DIRECTORIES
#
# these should probably be changed for production installations if you 
# follow the FHS (and you should).
datadir = ~/{{project}}/data
tmpdir = ~/{{project}}/tmp

# This should be the path to your development tree ... 
#   
#   i.e. /path/to/{{package}}/etc/plugins.d
#
plugin_config_dir = ~/devel/{{project}}/config/plugins.d


# This is just a cosmetic option... whether to show 'loading plugin...'
# on application startup.
#
show_plugin_load = false

# LOGGING
#
# Log file path, comment out if no log is required.
log_file = ~/{{project}}/log/{{project}}.log

# Toggle debug output... can be true, false
debug = false 

# Toggle the log level... can be info, warn, error, fatal, debug
log_level = warn

# Whether or not to log to console (this is overridden by 'debug')
log_to_console = true

# Max bytes to rotate log file on.  Comment out to not rotate log file.
#
# 512000000 = 512M
#
#log_max_bytes = 512000000 
#log_max_files = 4

# ROOT APPLICATION SETTINGS
#
# Add any config options you'd like here
#
# myoption = this is my option


# [namespace]
# Additional namespace/plugin configurations can go here.
